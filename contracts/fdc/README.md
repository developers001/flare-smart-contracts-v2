# FDC

Double governance
- Flare foundation governance
- Validator majority governance

For now just 2 governance addresses, where 1 is set to foundation governance and an option to add another governance address


## Adding attestation type fees

Any governance can update the attestation type and source pair fee. This is the minimal fee that needs to be provided in order for request to be considered

## Removing attestation type

Any governance can remove the attestation type and source pair fee, thus making the request impossible to be considered by the system. 
- We may want to keep an option to have some types and sources unremovable.
